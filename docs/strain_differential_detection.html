<p><summary> <strong style="color:red;">✖</strong> <strong>R Markdown file:</strong> uncommitted changes </summary> The R Markdown file has unstaged changes. To know which version of the R Markdown file created these results, you’ll want to first commit it to the Git repo. If you’re still working on the analysis, you can ignore this warning. When you’re finished, you can run <code>wflow_publish</code> to commit the R Markdown file and build the HTML.</p>

<p>Great job! The global environment was empty. Objects defined in the global environment can affect the analysis in your R Markdown file in unknown ways. For reproduciblity it’s best to always run the code in an empty environment.</p>

<p>The command <code>set.seed(12345)</code> was run prior to running the code in the R Markdown file. Setting a seed ensures that any results that rely on randomness, e.g. subsampling or permutations, are reproducible.</p>

Great! You are using Git for version control. Tracking code development and connecting the code version to the results is critical for reproducibility. The version displayed above was the version of the Git repository at the time these results were generated. <br><br> Note that you need to be careful to ensure that all relevant files for the analysis have been committed to Git prior to generating the results (you can use <code>wflow_publish</code> or <code>wflow_git_commit</code>). workflowr only checks the R Markdown file, but you know if there are other scripts or data files that it depends on. Below is the status of the Git repository when the results were generated:

<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Some genes may barely get over the threshold of 5 TPMs, which was chosen arbitrarily. We are not interested in those results. We want to see what transcripts are clearly abundant in one strain, while clearly absent or at the very least severely down-regulated in another strain. The question then becomes whether this is due to poor coverage across the gene (highly polymorphic) or actual low transcript copy number. MSP1 is an example of a highly polymorphic gene in HB3 versus 3D7. It is not covered very well across the gene and thus has been marked as “undetected.” MSP2 is an example of a gene that is detected, but is also highly polymorphic.</p>
